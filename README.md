# csv_to_sqlite3

Handles a CSV file containig more than 10,000 records about deaths in the United States (1999 - 2016) from multiple causes.
Data is handled using python for sqlite3
Data is put into sqlite3 database and is then queried.
Using this information and python functions, I created three line graphs using matplotlib
